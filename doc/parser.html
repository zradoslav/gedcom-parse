<h3><a name="Basic_testing"></a>Basic testing<br>

       </h3>

  You should be able to perform a basic test using the commands:<br>
             
<blockquote><code>./configure<br>
       make<br>
        make check</code><br>
         </blockquote>
        If everything goes OK, you'll see that some gedcom files are parsed,
  and   that each parse is successful. &nbsp;Note that some of the used gedcom files
  are  made by <a href="http://heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/gedcom.htm">Heiner
  Eichmann</a>       and are an excellent way to test gedcom parsers thoroughly.<br>
         <br>
                           
  
  <h3><a name="Preparing_for_further_testing"></a>Preparing for further testing</h3>
Some 
more detailed    tests are possible, via the <code>testgedcom</code> program 
that is generated    by <code>make</code>. &nbsp;<br>
         <br>
        However, since the output that <code>testgedcom</code> generates
is   in  UTF-8 format (more on this later), some preparation is necessary
to have  a full view on it. &nbsp;Basically, you need a terminal that understands
  and can display UTF-8 encoded characters, and you need to proper fonts
installed     to display them. &nbsp;I'll give some advice on this here,
based on the   Red  Hat 7.1 distribution that I use, with glibc 2.2 and XFree86
4.0.x. &nbsp;Any    other distribution that has the same or newer versions
for these components    should give the same results.<br>
         <br>
        For the first issue, the UTF-8 capable terminal, the safest bet is
 to  use    <code>xterm</code> in its unicode mode (which is supported by
the   <code>   xterm</code> coming with XFree86 4.0.x). &nbsp;UTF-8 capabilities 
  have only  recently been added to <code>gnome-terminal</code>, so probably 
  that is not  in your distribution yet (it certainly isn't in Red Hat 7.1).<br>
         <br>
        For the second issue, you'll need the ISO 10646-1 fonts. &nbsp;These
  come   also with XFree86 4.0.x.<br>
         <br>
        The way to start <code>xterm</code> in unicode mode is then e.g.
(put   everything  on 1 line !):<br>
                           
  <blockquote><code>LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 xterm -bg 'black' -fg 'DarkGrey' -cm
    -fn '-Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1'</code><br>
           </blockquote>
             This first sets the <code>LANG</code> variable to a locale that
  uses  UTF-8, and then starts <code>xterm</code> with a proper Unicode font.
  &nbsp;Some  sample UTF-8 plain text files can be found <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/ucs/examples">
       here</a>     . &nbsp;Just <code>cat</code> them on the command line
 and see the result.<br>
           <br>
                                         
    
    <h3><a name="Testing_the_parser_with_debugging"></a>Testing the parser with debugging</h3>

       Given the UTF-8 capable terminal, you can now let the <code>testgedcom</code>
        program print the values that it parses. &nbsp;An example of a command
   line is (in the top <code></code>directory):<br>
                                         
    <blockquote><code>./testgedcom -dg t/input/ulhc.ged</code><br>
             </blockquote>
       The <code>-dg</code> option instructs the parser to show its own debug 
  messages  &nbsp;(see <code>./testgedcom -h</code> for the full set of options).
  &nbsp;If  everything is OK, you'll see the values from the gedcom file,
containing  a lot of special characters.<br>
             <br>
       For the ANSEL test file (<code>t/ansel.ged</code>), you have to set
 the   environment variable <code>GCONV_PATH</code> to the <code>ansel</code>
   subdirectory   of the top directory:<br>
                                                       
      <blockquote><code>export GCONV_PATH=./ansel<br>
       ./testgedcom -dg t/input/ansel.ged<br>
               </code></blockquote>
       This is because for the ANSEL character set an extra module is needed
  for  the iconv library (more on this later). &nbsp;But again, this should
  show  a lot of special characters.<br>
               <br>
                                                                     
        
        <h3><a name="Testing_the_lexers_separately"></a>Testing the lexers separately</h3>

       The lexers themselves can be tested separately. &nbsp;For the 1-byte 
 lexer   (i.e. supporting the encodings with 1 byte per characters, such as
 ASCII,   ANSI and ANSEL), the command would be (in the <code>gedcom</code> subdirectory):<br>
                                                                     
        <blockquote><code>make lexer_1byte<br>
             </code></blockquote>
   This will generate a lexer program that can process e.g. the <code>t/input/allged.ged</code>
 test file. &nbsp;Simply cat the file through the lexer on standard input
and you should get all the tokens in the file. &nbsp;Similar  tests can be
done using <code>make lexer_hilo</code> and <code>
make lexer_lohi</code>
    (for the unicode lexers). &nbsp;In each of the cases you need to know
yourself which of the test files are appropriate to pass through the lexer.<br>
                 <br>
       This concludes the testing setup. &nbsp;Now for some explanations...<br>
          <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
                                                                         
         
          <h2><a name="Structure_of_the_parser"></a>Structure of the parser</h2>
       I see the structure of a program using the gedcom parser as follows:<br>
                 <br>
                 <img src="images/schema.png" alt="Gedcom parsing scheme">
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
       The parser is based on <code>lex/yacc</code>, which means that a module generated by <code>lex</code>
 takes the inputfile and determines the tokens in that file (i.e. the smallest
units, such as numbers, line terminators, GEDCOM tags, characters in GEDCOM
values...). &nbsp;These tokens are passed to the parser module, which is
generated by yacc, to parse the syntax of the file, i.e. whether the tokens
appear in a sequence that is valid. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
For each recognized statement in the GEDCOM file, the parser calls some callbacks,
which can be registered by the application to get the information out of
the file.<br>
          <br>
This basic description ignores the problem of character encoding.<br>
          <br>
          <h3><a name="Character_encoding"></a>Character encoding</h3>Refer to <a href="encoding.html">this page</a> for some introduction on character encoding...<br>

          <br>
GEDCOM defines three standard encodings:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>ASCII</li>
            <li>ANSEL</li>
            <li>UNICODE (assumed to be UCS-2, either big-endian or little-endian: the GEDCOM spec doesn't specify this)</li>
          </ul>These are all supported by the parser, and converted into UTF-8 format.<br>
