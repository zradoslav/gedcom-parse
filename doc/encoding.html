Developers are usually familiar with the ASCII character set. &nbsp;This
is a character set that assigns a unique number to some characters, e.g.
an "A" has ASCII code 65 (or 0x41 in hex), and an "a" has ASCII code 97 (or
0x61 in hex). &nbsp;Some people may also have used ASCII codes for several
drawing characters (such as a horizontal bar, a vertical bar, or a top-right
corner) in the old DOS days, to be able to draw nice windows in text mode.<br>
<br>

However, these last characters are strictly spoken not part of the ASCII
set. &nbsp;The standard ASCII set contains only the character positions from
0 to 127 (i.e. anything that fits into an integer that is 7 bits wide). &nbsp;An
example of this table can be found <a href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/%7Emichael/c/ascii-table.html">here</a>. &nbsp;Anything that has an ASCII code between 128 and 255 is in principle undefined.<br>
<br>

Now, several systems (including the old DOS) have defined those character
positions anyway, but usually in totally different ways. &nbsp;Some well
known extensions are:<br>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/cp437.gif">DOS</a>
 character set, nowadays usually known as Code Page 437, but sometimes also
named LatinUS, ECS (Extended Character Set) or PC-8; note that the table
displayed in the link also contains the standard ASCII part</li><li>the <a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/cp1252.gif">ANSI</a> character set, also known as Code Page 1252, and usually the default on Windows</li><li>the <a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859-1.gif">ISO-8859-1</a> character set (also called Latin-1), which is an ISO standard for Western European languages, mostly used on various Unices</li><li>the <a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/adobe-stdenc.gif">Adobe Standard Encoding</a>, which is by default used in Postscript, unless overridden</li>
</ul>

And these are only examples of character sets used in West-European languages.
&nbsp;For Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, ... there are separate character
sets in which one byte's meaning can even be influenced by what the previous
byte was, i.e. these are multi-byte character sets. &nbsp;This is because
even 256 characters (the maximum for 8 bits) is totally inadequate to represent all characters in
such languages.<br>
<br>

So, summarizing, if a text file contains a byte that has a value 65, it is
pretty safe to assume that this byte represents an "A", if we ignore the
multi-byte character sets spoken of before. &nbsp;However, a value 233 cannot
be interpreted without knowing in which character set the text file is written.
&nbsp;In Latin-1, it happens to be the character "&eacute;", but in another
character set it can be something totally different (e.g. in the DOS character
set it is the Greek letter theta).<br>
<br>

Vice versa, if you need to write a character "&eacute;" to a file, it depends
on the character set you will use what the numerical value will be in the
file: in Latin-1 it will be 233, but if you use the DOS character set it
will be 130.<br>
