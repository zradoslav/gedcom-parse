NOTE: NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY IS GUARANTEED FOR 0.x RELEASES !!

release 0.17 (??):

 - INTERFACE CHANGE: the callback functions now take an extra argument: the
   record/element identifier (that is also used as first argument in the
   *_subscribe_* functions).  The extra argument is the first argument.

 - INTERFACE CHANGE: Age values are now parsed: an extra type is added to
   the types possible in a Gedcom_val: an age_value (see documentation for
   details).  So, instead of GEDCOM_STRING, you now need to use GEDCOM_AGE
   for age values.
   As a quick change, you can use the raw_value instead of the parsed_value
   until you make the real change of using the struct age_value.

release 0.16 (16 August 2002):

 - Another bugfixing release.

 - Some compatibility with Lifelines 3.0.2 is added (not necessarily complete).

release 0.15 (27 March 2002):

 - Again mainly a bugfixing release

 - Compatibility with ftree is added, all GEDCOM files written by ftree
   should load fine now.

 - Note for developers: you now have to call the function gedcom_init()
   as soon as possible in your program (before any character set handling
   is done, see documentation for details).  If the function has not been
   called, gedcom_parse_file() will return an error.

release 0.14 (20 January 2002):

 - This is mainly a bugfixing release, no extra features have been added.

 - Some example code is available on how to convert from UTF-8 to the locale
   system, and how to check the library version via configure.in (see the
   documentation for details).

release 0.13 (5 January 2002):

 - Cross-references are now parsed and checked.  For this, an extra type is
   added to the types possible in a Gedcom_val: an xref pointer. This means
   that GEDCOM_XREF_PTR has to be used now in some places instead of
   GEDCOM_STRING.
   A quick change is to replace
     GEDCOM_STRING(val)
   by
     GEDCOM_XREF_PTR(val)->string
   where applicable.  But you can also store an object in the 'object' member
   of the struct returned by GEDCOM_XREF_PTR (see documentation).

 - Other interface changes in the callbacks:
    - parsed tag value (integer) is passed next to the string value
    - the start record callbacks now also contain a Gedcom_val (the NOTE can
      have a value)

 - Further, various bugfixes have been made.

release 0.12 (31 December 2001):

 - The calling of callbacks is now completed.

 - Some initial documentation is available.

 - The parsed value that is returned in callbacks can now be:
     - a null value
     - a string
     - a date (struct date_value)
   See the documentation for more info.  Parsing and checking of cross-
   references will be added next.

release 0.11 (15 December 2001):

 - Initial release from Sourceforge.net (developers only !)
