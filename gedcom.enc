# Mapping of charsets for gedcom parsing
# Each line contains (separated by whitespace):
#   - the gedcom name
#   - a token identifying the width of characters and the ordering;
#     currently supported values: 1, 2_LOHI, 2_HILO
#   - the iconv name of the charset

# First the encodings supported by the GEDCOM standard
UNICODE		2_LOHI	UNICODELITTLE
UNICODE		2_HILO	UNICODEBIG
ASCII		1	ASCII
ANSEL		1	ANSEL

# Then some very frequently used non-standard encodings:
# Note that CP1252 is a superset of ISO-8859-1, so that is covered too
ANSI		1	CP1252
