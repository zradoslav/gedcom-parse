<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The library <code>libutf8tools</code> is part of the GEDCOM parser library,
but it can be used in unrelated programs too. &nbsp;It provides some help
functions for handling UTF-8 encoding. &nbsp;It comes with the following
installed:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a library '<code>libutf8tools.so</code>', which should be linked in in your program</li>
  <li>a header '<code>utf8tools.h</code>', which should be included in the source code of your program</li>
</ul>
The following sections describe the features of the library.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h2><a name="UTF-8_string_functions"></a>UTF-8 string functions</h2>
The following simple functions are available to handle UTF-8 strings in general:<br>

                         
<blockquote>      
  <pre><code>int   <b>is_utf8_string</b> (char *input);<br>int   <b>utf8_strlen</b> (char *input);<br></code></pre></blockquote>
The
first one returns 1 if the given input is a valid UTF-8 string, it returns
0 otherwise, the second gives the number of UTF-8 characters in the given
input. &nbsp;Note that the second function assumes that the input is valid
UTF-8, and gives unpredictable results if it isn't.<br>

<h2><a name="Converting_character_sets"></a>Converting character sets</h2>
For conversion from and to UTF-8 there is a generic interface which gives
all the necessary flexibility, and a specific interface for conversion to
and from the locale, which is less flexible, but more straightforward.<br>
<h3><a name="Generic_interface"></a>Generic interface</h3>
<h4>Conversion handle</h4>
In general, the program needs to initialize a conversion handle before some
actual text can be converted to and from UTF-8. &nbsp;This initialization
(and the cleanup at the end) is performed via the following functions:
<blockquote>      
  <pre><code>convert_t   <b>initialize_utf8_conversion</b> (const char *charset, int ext_outbuf);<br>void   <b>     cleanup_utf8_conversion</b> (convert_t conv);<br></code></pre></blockquote>
The first function returns a conversion handle, which needs to be passed
to all generic conversion functions. &nbsp;Through this handle, bidirectional
conversion can take place between UTF-8 and the given character set <code>'charset'</code>.
&nbsp;The implementation of this handle is not visible to the program that
uses it. &nbsp;In case of an error, the returned value is NULL and <code>errno</code> gives the error that occurred.<br>
<br>
The second parameter <code>ext_outbuf </code>should be non-zero if you want
to control the output buffer yourself (see below). &nbsp;For normal circumstances,
you should pass 0 for this parameter.<br>
<br>
To avoid memory leaks, it is advised that conversion handles are cleaned up when not needed anymore, using the <code>cleanup_utf8_conversion</code> function. &nbsp;Note that after using this function, any access to the handle will result in undefined behaviour.<br>
<h4>Conversion functions</h4>
Once a conversion handle is initialized, it can be used to convert text between
UTF-8 and the given character set. &nbsp;There are three functions available
to do so:
<blockquote>      
  <pre><code>char* <b>convert_from_utf8</b> (convert_t conv, const char* input, int* conv_fails, size_t* output_len);<br><br>char* <b>convert_to_utf8</b> (convert_t conv, const char* input, size_t input_len);<br>char* <b>convert_to_utf8_incremental</b> (convert_t conv, const char* input, size_t input_len);<br></code></pre></blockquote>
All three functions take the conversion handle as first parameter, and the
text to convert as second parameter. &nbsp;They return a pointer to an output
buffer, which is overwritten at each call of the functions (unless you control
your own output buffers, see below). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The difference between the last two functions is that <code>convert_to_utf8</code> converts only entire strings (i.e. it resets the conversion state each time), whereas <code>convert_to_utf8_incremental</code>
takes previous conversions into account for the current conversion (left
over input characters from the previous conversion can then be combined with
the current input characters). &nbsp;If you pass <code>NULL</code> as input to <code>convert_to_utf8_incremental</code>, the conversion restarts from a clean state.<br>
<br>
Since conversion from UTF-8 to another character set can fail (it's possible
that some characters cannot be encoded in the target character set), the
function <code>convert_from_utf8</code> has a third parameter, <code>conv_fails</code>,
which can return the number of conversion failures in the input. &nbsp;Pass
a pointer to an integer if you're interested, or pass NULL otherwise. &nbsp;Note
that for conversion failures the string '?' will be put in the output instead
of the character that could not be converted. &nbsp;This string can be changed
using:<br>
<blockquote>      
  <pre><code>int <b>conversion_set_unknown</b> (convert_t conv, const char *unknown);</code><br></pre>
  </blockquote>
Some character sets use wide characters to encode text. &nbsp;But since the
conversion functions above for simplicity all need and return normal <code>char</code>
strings, it is necessary to know in some cases how long the strings are (if
the string is actually using wide characters, then it cannot be considered
a null-terminated string, so <code>strlen</code> cannot work on it). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
For this reason, the function <code>convert_from_utf8</code> has a fourth
parameter which can return the length of the output string (pass NULL if
you know you don't need it), and the other functions have an <code>input_len</code> parameter, which should always be the string length of the <code>input</code> string, even if it could also be retrieved via strlen.<br>
<h4>Controlling the output buffer<br>
</h4>
In some cases, you'd like to control the output buffer yourself, e.g. when
you want to have multiple output buffers for the efficiency of not having
to copy the strings. &nbsp;This can be done by declaring your intention at
the initialization of the conversion handle (see above). &nbsp;In that case,
the initialization doesn't allocate an output buffer itself, and you have
to control it via the following functions, before you can do any conversion:
<blockquote>      
  <pre><code>conv_buffer_t <b>create_conv_buffer</b> (int initial_size);<br>void          <b>free_conv_buffer</b> (conv_buffer_t buf);<br><br>int           <b>conversion_set_output_buffer</b> (convert_t conv, conv_buffer_t buf);<br></code></pre></blockquote>
The first function returns a handle to a new conversion buffer with given
initial size (the buffer is expanded dynamically when necessary). &nbsp;The
second function frees the buffer: all further access to the buffer handle
will result in undefined behaviour.<br>
<br>
The third function allows to set the current output buffer for the given
conversion handle. &nbsp;This allows to switch between output buffers. &nbsp;The
function returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.<br>
<h3><a name="Specific_locale_conversion"></a>Specific locale conversion<br>
</h3>
For conversion to the current locale, there is a simpler interface available,
which takes care of the conversion handle implicitly. &nbsp;The following
functions are available:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre><code></code><code>char *<b>convert_utf8_to_locale</b> (char *input, int *conv_failures);<br>char *<b>convert_locale_to_utf8</b> (char *input);<br></code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  </blockquote>

    Both functions return a pointer to a static buffer that is overwritten
 on each call. &nbsp;To function properly, the application must first set
the locale using the <code>setlocale</code> function.
 &nbsp;<br>
                         <br>
   If you pass a pointer to an integer to the first function, it will be
set  to the number of conversion failures, i.e. characters that couldn't
be converted;  you can also just pass <code>NULL</code> if you are not interested
(note  that usually, the interesting information is just whether there <i>
were</i>    conversion failures or not, which is then given by the integer
being bigger  than zero or not). &nbsp;The second function doesn't need this,
because any  locale can be converted to UTF-8.<br>
                         <br>
    You can change the "?" that is output for characters that can't be converted 
 to any string you want, using the following function before the conversion 
 calls:<br>
                           
<blockquote>      
  <pre><code>void <b>convert_set_unknown</b> (const char *unknown);</code><br></pre>
  </blockquote>

<pre>                    </pre>
